# 🚀 This is my portfolio-like app

## 🧐 What's inside?

This is where I'll gather all the experiments I consider fun to play with/study and best-practices to use.
    
And inside you have:    

1. Supports dark mode and 日本語🇯🇵/English🇺🇸 locales (checkout css variables and https://airbnb.io/polyglot.js)
2. My custom square block element with some cool transitions 
3.  **React js test renderer.** -> https://satisfactorium.com/experiments/squares

    with square element and it's useState animations -> you can check hom much react cand render simalteniously.
    I found that at around 3500 list elements the FPS starts to drop

4.  **Square-game.** -> https://satisfactorium.com/experiments/squares-game

    A square element based game! Where you'll need to turn all the squares in to circles :)
    All pure react and css based
