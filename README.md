# 🚀 This is my portfolio-like app

## 🧐 What's inside?

Here I'll gather all the experiments I consider fun to play with/study and best-practices to use.

And inside you have:    

1. Supports dark mode and 日本語🇯🇵/English🇺🇸 locales (checkout css variables and https://airbnb.io/polyglot.js)
2. My custom square block element with some cool transitions 
3.  **React js test renderer.** -> https://satisfactorium.com/experiments/squares

    with square element and it's useState animations -> you can check hom much react cand render simalteniously.
    I found that at around 3500 list elements the FPS starts to drop

4.  **Square-game.** -> https://satisfactorium.com/experiments/squares-game

    A square element based game! Where you'll need to turn all the squares in to circles :)
    All pure react and css based

## Why the name satisfactorium?

Cuz it gives me amounts of satisfation working on it seeing the end result. As devlopers we are constantly limited in ways we think things should be done due to number of reasons. So this is my place to do exactly the way I believe things should be done and imense amounts of happy code and mood comes as a result 😌
