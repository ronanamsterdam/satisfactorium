# 🚀 This is my portfolio app

## 🧐 What's inside?

This is my portfolio app where I'll gather all the experiments I consider fun to play with and study
    
And inside you have:    
    
1. My custom square block element with some cool transitions 
2.  **React js test renderer.**

    with square element and it's useState animations -> you can check hom much react cand render simalteniously.
    I found that at around 3500 list elements the FPS starts to drop 
   

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

3.  **Square-game.**

    A square element based game! Where you'll need to turn all the squares in to circles :)
    All pure react and css based
